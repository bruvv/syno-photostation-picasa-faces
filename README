This programm is designed and tested with Synology Photos Station 6 Beta (PS) to 
handle already tagged persons in image exif-data, which where tagged by free
Google software Picasa.

Each run will read new indexed images from PS databases (common and users) 
since last run. Then it will look for Picasa XMP person tags. If found
such information, it will write the information to the PS database and although
as Microsoft XMP tags, which are used by Photostation, back to the file.

Notices:

- Each file with Picasa tags will be modified with exiv2 programm which is 
  installed in the DS Firmware. Images maybe broken afterwards so make a 
  BACKUP before using.
  
- Database schemata of PS can be changed by Synology, script will 
  not work correct and damage the database. Although make a backup 
  of the PS databases or you will have to reindex again.

- Report issues at https://syno-photostation-picasa-faces.googlecode.com/

How to use:

1.  Wait until DiskStation have finished the indexing of all images. Only
    already indexed images will be noticed by the script.

2.  Copy picasaXMPFaceToDatabaseAndXMPMP.php to your DiskStation

3.  Make a backup of your photos in shared-folder /photo and /home/photo

4.  Backup your databases.

5.  Go to Webinterface of your DiskStation and enable SSH-service
    Control-Panel -> Terminal
   
6.  For Windows User download free SSH-Client Putty.exe

7.  Login via ssh client with connection string root@<IP-DISKSTATION> and your admin-password

8.  Change shell prompt for better overview:

    PS1="\u@\h:\w>"

9.  Copy the php-script to this directory:

    cp <PATH-TO-FILE>/picasaXMPFaceToDatabaseAndXMP.php /volume1/@appstore/PhotoStation/photo_scripts/
   
    <PATH-TO-FILE> normally something like: /volume1/homes/<USERNAME>/
   
    Notice: I have no idea yet why the script is working correctly only in this directory 
    and can not lay in other directories
   
10. Change to directory:
	
    cd /volume1/@appstore/PhotoStation/photo_scripts/
   
11. Run script:

	php picasaXMPFaceToDatabaseAndXMPMP.php
	
12. If script execution timeout (for example on very first run) just execute again

13. Enjoy you're Picasa faces in PS.

14. You can re-run the script each time you have uploaded new images and DS have 
    finished the indexing of these files.
